# ATS Model Data Archive (MDA) Reporting Format v 1.0.0

## About

This repository provides a lightweight **reporting format** and an accompanying **workflow notebook** for packaging results from **Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS)** simulations as a **Model Data Archive (MDA)** suitable for publication and long-term stewardship (e.g., in **ESS-DIVE**).

The intent is to help ATS users produce a package that is:

- **Curated** (contains the files you intend to publish, without unnecessary intermediates),
- **Documented** (includes file-level metadata and a data dictionary for tabular outputs), and
- **Transferable** (optional archiving/splitting support for large directories).

## What this repository provides

- `ats_mda_workflow.ipynb`: the end-to-end workflow notebook (copy → cleanup → metadata tables → optional packaging).
- `instructions.md`: background and a step-by-step guide aligned with the notebook.
- Templates generated by the workflow:
  - `flmd.csv` (File Level Metadata)
  - `dd.csv` (Data Dictionary)

## What the workflow produces

Running the notebook against an ATS simulation directory produces a curated destination directory (commonly named `my_ATS_MDA/`) that contains:

- selected input/output artifacts (based on include rules you configure),
- `flmd.csv` and `dd.csv`, and optionally:
- `sha256sums.txt` (checksum manifest for integrity verification),
- one `*.tar.gz` per top-level subdirectory (e.g., `run0.tar.gz`, `run1.tar.gz`), with optional splitting into `*.partNNN` files when archives exceed 5 GiB.

## Quickstart Guide

1. **Read** `instructions.md` to understand the expected package contents and the workflow steps.
2. **Edit** the configuration block in `ats_mda_workflow.ipynb` to point to your simulation directory and choose what to include.
3. **Run** the notebook to generate `my_ATS_MDA/`, `flmd.csv`, and `dd.csv` (and optional packaging outputs).
4. **Review** the curated directory and **edit** `flmd.csv` / `dd.csv` to ensure descriptions and definitions are accurate.
5. **Submit** the curated package to ESS-DIVE using their submission workflow.
